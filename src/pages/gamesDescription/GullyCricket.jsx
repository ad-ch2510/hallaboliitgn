                <ul className='guidlines'>
                    <li>Each inning would be 6 overs.</li>
                    <li>Maximum 2 players can bowl 2 overs each. A girl must bowl at least 1 over.</li>
                    <li>In the girl’s over, the bowling team can dismiss the batsman by catching the ball on one bounce and in one hand.</li>
                    <li>The total number of runs scored by a girl will be doubled. Also, when a girl is
                        batting, and the ball touches the bat, provided that it is a dot ball, then one run will be added to the total. All other rules regarding runs will be announced before the match.</li>
                    <li>The batting team is allowed to take a "Hallabol Over", in which runs scored by the batting team will be doubled. At the same time, in this over, the bowling team can dismiss the batsman by catching the ball on one bounce and in one hand. The decision to take the "Hallabol Over" should be made before the start of the over. It’s compulsory for every team to take “Hallabol Over.” The batting team has to announce the Hallabol Over first, and then the bowling may choose which bowler will bowl that particular over.</li>
                    <li>All the usual international rules like wide, no balls are ON.</li>
                    <li>A player can be declared ‘retired hurt’ only after completing an over. However,
                        retired players can bat again only after every remaining player gets out.</li>
                    <li>Only throw bowling (with at max one-step run-up) will be allowed with speed
                        restriction, which will be looked after by the Umpire only.</li>
                    <li>All the other rules will be announced to both teams before the match starts.</li>
                    <li>The umpire's decision would be considered final in case of any discrepancy.</li>
